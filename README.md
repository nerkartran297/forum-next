Also, the different URLs for the Clerk sign-in, sign-up, after sign-in and after sign-up pages.

## ðŸ”’ Environment Variables

Environment variables[^12] can be used for configuration. They must be set before running the app.

> [Environment variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable) are variables that are set in the operating system or shell, typically used to configure programs.

**DevOverflow** uses [Clerk](https://clerk.com), [TinyMCE](https://uploadthing.com/), [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com), [OpenAI API](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api) and [MongoDB](https://mongodb.com) as external services. You need to create an account on each of these services and get the required credentials to run the app.

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add the following environment variables:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=<CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY>
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=<CLERK_SECRET_KEY>
NEXT_CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET=<CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET>

NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_IN_URL=/
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_UP_URL=/onboarding

NEXT_PUBLIC_TINY_MCE_API_KEY=<YOUR_TINY_MCE_API_KEY>

MONGODB_URL=<YOUR_MONGODB_URL>

NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_URL=<YOUR_SERVER_URL>

OPENAI_API_KEY=<YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY>

RAPID_API_KEY=<YOUR_RAPID_API_KEY>
```
